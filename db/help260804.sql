Sometimes all that is required is to do is to declare an existing method accessible over XML-RPC.<br> \n<br>\nTo make use of the ROD XML RPC, it needs to be called from a program. The following is an example for the Python programming language: \n<blockquote>\n  <p><br>\n  import xmlrpclib<br> \n  <br>\n  server = xmlrpclib.Server(\'http://rod.eionet.eu.int/rpcrouter\')<br> \n  result = server.WebRODService.getActivities()</p>\n  <p>if not result:<br> \n     print \"No value returned\"</p> \n  <p>else:<br>\n     print result</p> \n</blockquote>\n<p><br>\nThe ROD XML RPC Router is: <a href=\"http://rod.eionet.eu.int/rpcrouter\">http://rod.eionet.eu.int/rpcrouter</a>.
